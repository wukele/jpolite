[http://www.trilancer.com/jpolite/g/netvibes_sample.jpg]

It was all inspired by [http://www.netvibes.com/ Netvibes] - the personalized web portal. 

Netvibes enables individuals to assemble their favorite widgets on the web all in one place, while I'd like to bring that convenience to *web developers* to handle content integration tasks in a rapid and convenient manner.

= Philosophy =
Please share some of my design philosophy: 

 * *Less is more* - instead of building a full-blown framework with tons of features, only minimum necessary ones are provided for easier jump start.
 * *Separation of Content, Appearance and Behavior* - No action and styling code is used in HTML. By following simple conventions, a plain HTML section can be automatically turned into a vivid control, e.g., Tabs, Accordion ...
 * *Convention over configuration* - By following simple naming conventions, new content can be loaded without complex and error-prone configuration or settings.
 * *It is easier to make simple things better than making better things simple* - Yes, lots "traditional" portal features are omitted - purposely. But enhancements as well as customization can be applied at ease.
The target of this framework is to provide a handy tool for easy content integration. Yet I believe it is powerful enough to serve as cornerstone for more advanced portals.
