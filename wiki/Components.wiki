= Tabs =
The tabs are defined in index.html "header_tabs" section with id "t1", "t2", "t3" ... respectively

= Helper =
An optional helper part below the tabs, named exactly after the tab it belongs to, a.k.a., "t2.html".

= Columns =
Three columns defined in section "main" of index.html, namely "c1", "c2" and "c3", are provided as main containers for modules, which shall be enough in most cases.

= Modules =
A.k.a. "portlets" in traditional terms. A module's content should be encoded in plain HTML without the HTML, HEADER and BODY tags. A DOCTYPE is omitted, but the markup should be consistent with that of index.html.
