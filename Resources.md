# Pros & Cons #
  * **Pros**: Easy & rapid integration of content, with minimum JavaScript knowledge required.
  * **Cons**: Poor SEO support by design, most content invisible to Search Engines.

# Verdict #
  * This framework may best suit Dynamic Web Applications, aka, feed content to user only after login (invisible to SE by default).
  * The target is to bring up a Useful and Usable framework, through proper integration of existing tech components, thus
  * Some Debuging and Finetuning work are still needed in JavaScript and CSS details to better support more browsers.
Thus, comments and critics are more than welcome to make this framework more useful to more developers.
